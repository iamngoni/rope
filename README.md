# Rope Dart

A fast, immutable rope data structure in Dart using a SumTree architecture.
Inspired by Zed's implementation, this rope is optimized for large-scale string manipulation and editor-like use cases.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **SumTree-based architecture** with node-level summaries
- Efficient `insert`, `delete`, `split`, `concat`, `substring`, `charAt`
- Multi-line and character-aware summaries (`TextSummary`)
- Designed for speed, immutability, and extensibility

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```yaml
dependencies:
  rope:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/iamngoni/rope.git
```

Or

```yaml
dependencies:
  rope: <version>
```

## ðŸ§± What is a Rope?

A **rope** is a tree-based data structure for storing and editing large strings efficiently. Zed uses a generalized B+ tree called a **SumTree**, where each node summarizes its subtree (e.g., character length, line count).

This enables:
- O(log n) character access and mutation
- Efficient line/column â†” offset conversion
- Concurrent snapshotting & persistence

## ðŸ›  Example Usage

```dart
void main() {
  final rope = Rope.fromString("Hello World!");

  final inserted = rope.insert(5, ", beautiful");
  print(inserted); // Hello, beautiful World!

  final deleted = inserted.delete(5, 16);
  print(deleted); // Hello World!

  final char = rope.charAt(1);
  print(char); // e

  final substring = rope.substring(0, 5);
  print(substring); // Hello

  final (left, right) = rope.split(6);
  print(left);  // Hello
  print(right); // World!
}
```

## ðŸ§ª Running Tests

Use the `test` package:

```bash
dart test
```

## ðŸ§  Internals

Each rope is a SumTree of `Chunk` nodes:

```dart
class Rope {
  final SumTreeNode<Chunk> root;
}
```

Each node maintains a `TextSummary`:
```dart
class TextSummary {
  final int length;
  final int lines;
}
```

This allows efficient traversal and slicing of large text structures.
